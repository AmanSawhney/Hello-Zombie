## Game Design

### Objective
To navigate through a foriegn wasteland and kill as many zombies as possible
### Gameplay Mechanics
Players tap on the left or right while the player is moving constently to the right.  Taping on the left allows the player to jump with a max of two jumps per platform and tapping right allows the player to shoot the zombies.  Zombies can kill zombies in two ways:
<ul> 
<li> Jumping and landing on top of them </li>
<li> Shooting them with their blaster </li>
</ul>

The player only gains points by killing zombies, and with each death the player moves faster and faster. 
### Level Design
There are no levels; There is only one-player game mode.

### Controls/Input
* Touch based controls - Outlined in the game play mechanics
